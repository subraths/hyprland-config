# Hyprsunset configuration for blue light filtering
# This adjusts color temperature based on time of day

# Default temperature (6500K is neutral daylight)
# Lower values (3000-4000K) are warmer/more red
# Higher values (6500-7000K) are cooler/more blue

# You can set different temperatures for different times
# Example configuration:

# Set temperature directly (uncomment to use)
# temperature = 4000

# Or use time-based configuration (uncomment and adjust as needed)
# sunrise-time = 07:00
# sunset-time = 19:00
# day-temperature = 6500
# night-temperature = 3500

# Simple always-on warm temperature (comment out if using time-based)
temperature = 4500
